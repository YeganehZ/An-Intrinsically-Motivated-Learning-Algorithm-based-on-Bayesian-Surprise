# An Intrinsically Motivated Learning Algorithm based on Bayesian Surprise for Cognitive Radar in Autonomous Vehicles

This repository contains my MATLAB codes for those interested in implementing my results published in "An Intrinsically Motivated Learning Algorithm based on Bayesian Surprise for Cognitive Radar in Autonomous Vehicles". I have included a PDF of my journal paper, followed by two folders named highway and in-city. The highway file includes all the codes to run the highway driving experience discussed in the paper. Meanwhile, the in-city file includes all the codes to run the in-city driving experience depicted in the paper. In both files, please run the main file to plot the system performance with respect to the root mean square error (RMSE). Before running the codes please review the simulation setup detailed thoroughly in Section 4 of the paper.
